Dear Mr. Guzdial, 

I am writing to remind you of the offer
that we sent to you last week.  Everyone in
Decatur knows what an exceptional offer this is!
(Especially those with lovely eyes of brown!)
We hope to hear from you soon.

Your pet dog, Fifi, will love our offer!

Sincerely,
I. M. Acrook
